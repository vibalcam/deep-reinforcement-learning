# CSCE-689: Deep Reinforcement Learning

Implementation of multiple Reinforcement Learning algorithms tested using OpenAI Gym environments.

List of algorithms implemented:
- Value Iteration (and asynchronous version)
- Policy Iteration
- Monte-Carlo Control (with and without importance sampling)
- Tabular Q-Learning
- SARSA
- Q-Learning with Function Approximator
- Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
- REINFORCE + State value estimator as baseline
- Advantage Actor Critic (A2C)
